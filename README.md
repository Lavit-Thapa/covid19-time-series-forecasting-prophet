# ðŸ§  COVID-19 Time Series Forecasting with Prophet  
**_Forecasting with Purpose - Learning with Passion_**

Welcome to my hands-on time series forecasting project, where I dove headfirst into the world of time aware modeling using Facebook's **Prophet** library. This notebook is more than just lines of code - it's a manifestation of my curiosity, my desire to explore predictive analytics, and my commitment to becoming a better data scientist one experiment at a time.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

COVID-19 has impacted the world in countless ways, and one powerful way to understand its trends is through data. In this project, I used the **Prophet** model to forecast COVID-19 case trends using historical daily case data.  

The goals of the project were:  
- âœ… Apply Prophet for time series forecasting  
- âœ… Practice preprocessing, visualization, and forecasting workflows  
- âœ… Experiment and learn from model behavior and diagnostics  
- âœ… Communicate findings clearly and cleanly

## ðŸ“ˆ Workflow Summary

1. **Data Wrangling**  
   - Read `Covid_19.csv` and cleaned the data  
   - Renamed columns to Prophet-friendly format: `ds` and `y`

2. **Model Fitting**  
   - Initialized Prophet and fit the model on historical data  
   - Generated future data points  
   - Predicted future trends

## ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings

- Prophet is incredibly user-friendly - it handles seasonality and holiday effects with minimal setup
- Time series forecasting isnâ€™t just about accuracy - interpretability and communication are key
- Small changes in parameters or preprocessing can drastically affect long-term forecasts
- Real-world data is messy and requires thoughtful wrangling
